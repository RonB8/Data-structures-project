# Data-structures-project

Description:
The project was done as part of the course "Data Structure and Introduction to Algorithms" in the degree, and its purpose is to compare 2 types of sorting: quick sorting and heap sorting. Attached is a pdf document explaining the reasons for the differences between the efficiency of the 2 different algorithms, and why you can get different results for different inputs.

The files:
The main file - SortComparison
Help files for main: HeapsMethods, Methods, MinHeap and QuickSortMethods
File analysis and comparison between the 2 algorithms: Performance comparison and analysis

To run the program, run the file - "SortComparison", and follow the instructions printed on the screen.
